.title: C<->ML (aka Foreign) Interface Examples

.intro: This directory contains examples for the foreign interface
 most/all of which are distributed to customers.


ADDING A NEW EXAMPLE

.add.dir: Create a directory for the test.  In the following assume
 that the test is called 'foo'.

.add.test: Create a test for the example, see .test.

.add.ans: If the example can be tested automatically, then construct
 an answer, see .make.ans.

.add.ans.add: When adding the answer to hope, include "-binary" if
 using hope directly, or pass "-B" to the add script
 <URI:hope://MLW/tools/add> to ensure that the answer is added in
 binary format.

.add.dist: If the example is to be distributed to customers, then it
 needs to be included in the distribution, see .dist for
 information on how to do this.



FORMAT OF EXAMPLE TEST

.test: There are two types of tests, manual and automatic.

.test.man: If it is not possible to construct a fully automatic test
 for a particular example (say it has a GUI component), then create a
 file called foo/MANUAL containing instructions on how to manually test
 the example. 

.test.auto: If the example can be tested automatically, then it needs
 the following components :-

.test.auto.platform: A script called foo/PLATFORM.sh which indicates
 which platforms the test can run on.  This script should read the
 environment variables $OS and $ARCH to determine if the test is
 applicable to that combination and return success (0) if it is.

.test.auto.main: The main script must be called foo/TEST.sh

.test.auto.out: For the test to be useful it needs to create some output.
 At a minimum this can just be something that indicates whether the
 test succeeded or not (e.g. "yes" or "no").

.test.auto.out.sink: script should write any output stdout.

.test.auto.out.sml: By convention any SML commands that need to fed
 into MLWorks are stored in foo/TEST.sml, but you are free to alter
 that as necessary when you create foo/TEST.sh.

.test.auto.ans: The correct result of running a test should be stored
 in foo/TEST.ans -- see .make.ans.

.test.auto.form: foo/TEST.sh building the .so/.dll, running MLWorks
 loading 

.test.auto.form.version: Do some OS/ARCH testing to work out which
 Makefile and source-path to use.

.test.auto.form.make: Run make to build the .so/.dll

.test.auto.form.sml: Run MLWorks taking its input from foo/TEST.sml

.test.auto.form.exec: If .test.auto.form.sml involves dumping an
 executable, then run the executable.

.test.auto.sh: all the scripts should be written in sh and have the
 extension ".sh".  The ".sh" extension isn't strictly necessary
 anymore and could be removed if desired.  It harks back to the time
 when MKS sh was used which required this extension.


TESTING AN EXAMPLE

.testing.man: For a manual test, follow the instructions in foo/MANUAL.


.testing.auto.test.one: To check that the result of a test is correct,
 run check_foreign_result.sh from this directory.  For example, to
 test foo do 

   $ ./check_foreign_result.sh foo

 There will not be any output unless a test fails.  


.testing.auto.test.all: To run all automatic tests, use
 check_foreign_results.sh  

   $ ./check_foreign_results.sh


.testing.auto.test.daily: All automatic tests are also run from the daily
 script <URI:hope//MLW/tools/daily>.


.testing.auto.fail: If a test fails, it will leave behind a file
 called TEST.out in the test directory which contains the output from
 the last run of the test.  For example, if testing foo fails, 
 the file foo/TEST.out will contain the output from the last run.



MAKING A TEST ANSWER

.make.ans: The preferred method for constructing test answers is to
 use either of the following approaches.


.make.ans.one: To construct the answer for a particular example, use
 make_foreign_answer.sh.  For example, to create the answer for foo :-

   $ ./make_foreign_answer.sh foo

 If an answer already exists, then make_foreign_answer will only
 overwrite the file if it is writable.


.make.ans.all: To construct answer files for all automatic tests, use
 make_foreign_answers.sh.  For example :-

  $ ./make_foreign_answers.sh



PLATFORMS

.platform: To save writing the same type of platform testing code 
 in each test, a few of the more common varieties have been written
 and can be called directly from foo/PLATFORM.sh

.platform.all: platform_all.sh succeeds for any platform.

.platform.unix: platform_unix.sh succeeds if the platform is running Unix.

.platform.win32: platform_win32.sh succeeds if the platform is running
 NT/Win95. 

As an example of a less common type of platform :-

.platform.unix: platform_unix.sh succeeds if the platform is running SunOS.

.platform.opengl: platform_opengl.sh succeeds if the platform supports
 OpenGL (at least in theory, I haven't checked to see if we really
 have the libraries installed).



DISTRIBUTING AN EXAMPLE

.dist: To ensure that an example is included in a distribution, you
 need to create an example specific distribution script (.dist.sh) and
 possibly alter the PC install script (.dist.pc.inst).

.dist.sh: Each example has its own distribution script called foo/DIST.sh

.dist.sh.dir: The script should expect to be run from the directory foo.

.dist.sh.arg: This script should expect three arguments: the directory
 in which the files should be deposited, the OS setting and the ARCH
 settting.  The OS and ARCH are optional under Unix, but necessary
 under NT.

.dist.pc.inst: If the example runs under Win95/NT, then you will also
 need to update the PC install script
 <URI:hope://MLW/tools/inst.bat> to ensure that the example is copied
 correctly -- just make a copy of the line that adds the "add" example
 and replace "add" with whatever the new example is called.

.dist.all: The distribution of all the foreign examples is taken care
 of by dist_foreign_files.sh which is called from
 <URI:hope://MLW/src/Makefile>.



DESIGN

.design.ancestor: The design of the testing mechanism is based loosely
 on that used in the test-suite.

.design.options: Unlike the test-suite scripts, the foreign test
 scripts take few if any options.  This is because I've rarely used
 any of the options available in those scripts, the exceptions being 
 the -src and -dir options.  The former is an optional argument to the
 foreign scripts and the latter is controlled by the $OS and $ARCH
 environment variable settings.  If you find this too limiting, by all
 means add more options as you see fit.

.design.platform.alt: An alternative to the foo/PLATFORM.sh approach
 is to use the find based mechanism that is used in the test-suite.
 There isn't much to choose between them.  The deciding factor is that
 in the foo/PLATFORM.sh approach it is relatively easy to indicate
 which platforms a test can run on whereas in the find based approach
 it is necessary to work out which tests cannot be run on a given
 platform (rather than which can, which is arguably easier to determine).

.design.platform-indepedent: The scripts have been written under the
 assumption that the answer for a test is the same for any platform
 on which the test can be run.

.design.single-threaded: A consequence of .design.platform-independent
 is that it is not possible to run the foreign tests for two different
 platforms concurrently.  However, given that except in the case of
 SunOS and Solaris it isn't possible to have two MLWorks for different
 OSes running at the same time, this doesn't seem to be an important
 restriction at present.  If/When the all uses of (soft) links are
 removed from the MLWorks development tree, it will be possible to run
 multiple versions of MLWorks and so .design.platform-independent will
 been to be revisited.
