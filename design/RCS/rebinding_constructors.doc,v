CONSTRUCTOR REBINDING
---------------------

In SML'90, once an identifier was known to be a constructor, it
couldn't be rebound (except as another constructor).  In SML'96, this
is no longer the case.  A consequence of the simplification of the
definition is that the constructor status of a value identifier may be
overwritten in a val rec (and hence function) declaration.

This note describes the main details of the implementation, all of
which are localised in the parser.


files: parser/_actionfunctions.sml
       parser/ml-tables/actions.data
       parser/ml-tables/gotos.data


The fundamental change concerned the nonterminal VARDEF.  both VARDEF
and LONGVAR have identical syntactic productions (though different
actions):

	VARDEF <- :longid
	LONGVAR <- :longid

Which causes a reduce-reduce conflict in the LALR parser.  We use the
LISPWORKS parser generator, and there the conflict is resolved by the
statement

   (((:reduce (vardef :longid)) (:reduce (longvar :longid)))
     (:funcall ifvarstack (:reduce (vardef :longid))
		          (:reduce (longvar :longid))))

which tells the parser that in order to resolve the conflict between
the above two productions, we have to call the function denoted by
ifvarstack, given the two actions "reduce longid to vardef" and
"reduce longid to longvar" as parameters.  This particular function
call is implemented by the _actionfunctions.sml:ifVarStack function.
The only change is in the clause

	| SOME (Ident.CON _) => conred

which becomes

	| SOME (Ident.CON _) => if oldDefinition then conred else varred

This means that in SML'96, every Constructor is regarded as a VARDEF,
even if it will not ultimately be used in this way.  Note that the
production for VARDEF becomes

	(* 	((VARDEF :longid))  *)

	       fn ([LONGID ([],id)],opts) => 
	          let val valid = resolveValId id 
	           in if get_old_definition opts
        	        then check_not_short_constructor (opts,valid)
	              else (); VALID valid
        	  end
	       | ([LONGID (longid as (_,id))],opts) =>
	            (report_long_error (opts,longid,"variable"); 
	            VALID (Ident.VAR id))
	 | _ => raise ActionError 189,

which checks that vardefs aren't short constructors only in SML'90
mode.


Parsing Functions
-----------------

Even though the definition treats function declarations as derived
forms of val rec decs, the parser treats the two separately.  The
individual function binding productions concern the FVAL nonterminal.
There are seven of these, three of which are error cases.  It's here
that the above modification of the reduce-reduce conflict counts.  All
we have to do is convert every constructor Ident.CON x that occurs as
a VARDEF here into an Ident.VAR x (this is done by the function
varify) and continue as before.

.val.vs.val.rec:


Parsing Val Rec Declarations
----------------------------

This is a real pain.  The problem here is that when we are building
VALBIND productions we do not know whether or not they will occur as
val decs or val rec decs.  This has the following consequence: if a
valbind production will belong to a val dec, then a constructor (such
as NONE) may occur many times.  However, if the production belongs to
a val rec dec, then each constructor may occur only once in a VARDEF
position (i.e., NONE may occur only once).  It seems that at this
point the most sensible route is to assume that constructors are not
going to be overwritten (which allows more than one instance of
constructors in VARDEF positions) and then backtrack if we
subsequently discover we're in a val rec dec.  This route also seems
optimal because val rec decs almost never occur in real code.

Thus, in the relevant production for ATPATS (atomic patterns):

	ATPAT <- OPVARDEF

the action becomes:

       fn ([VALID id],opts) => 
         PAT (Absyn.VALpat (annotate' (make_long_id id),
                            get_location opts),
              if is_constructor id then PE.empty_pVE
                                   else make_pVE id,Set.empty_set)

Thus, a constructor is never treated as bindable (i.e., parsing a
constructor in a VARDEF will always return an empty parser Value
Environment), but true vars are given singleton value environments.
(See parser documentation.)

Val decs can then be parsed as before.  The last change occurs at the
val rec production:

   VALBIND <- :rec VALBIND

where the action becomes

     fn ([_,VALBIND (v1,v2,tyvars,pVE)],opts) =>
        (check_rec_bindings (opts,v1); 
         let val vbind = VALBIND ([],v2@@v1,tyvars,pVE)
          in if get_old_definition opts then vbind
             else varify_valbind (vbind,opts)  (* change all constructors
                                           that occur in var positions
                                           into vars (so can be rebound)*)
         end)

The crucial clause is the last one, where in SML'96 mode, every
constructor that occurs in a VARDEF position in the argument valbind
is converted into a variable, so that it can be rebound.  Note that it
is at this point that multiple occurrences of ex-constructor VARDEFs
are rejected.  The definition of the function varify_valbind
essentially just recurses over the definition of patterns.
