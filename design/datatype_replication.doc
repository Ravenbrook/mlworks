WHAT IS DATATYPE REPLICATION?
-----------------------------

See section G.6 of the revised definition of SML.  We include a
new form of declaration (specification):

	datatype tycon = datatype longtycon

When elaborated, this binds tycon to the entire type structure (value
constructors included) to which longtycon is bound inthe context.
Datatype replication does *not* generate a new datatype: the original
and the replicated datatype share.

It implicitly introduces the value constructors of longtycon into
the current scope.

CHANGES TO ABSTRACT SYNTAX
--------------------------

important files: basics/absyn.sml basics/_absyn.sml

We add two new constructors:

*to the Dec datatype:

	DATATYPErepl of Ident.Location.T *
                        (Ident.TyCon * Ident.LongTyCon) *
                         Datatypes.Valenv option ref

The first specifies where the datatype replication was declared
(in which file/window, which structure/function etc. as standard.
It's used in error messages.

The second is a pair specifying the 

	tycon
	longtycon

components of the replication, and the last is a hook onto which we
will hang the replicated value environment (i.e., the values which
belong to the original typeconstructor longtycon.  At parsing time,
this is set to ref NONE, and is set to (ref SOME ...) by the
typechecker.  See the section on Lambda translation for its
motivation.  (See typechecker/_core_rules.sml, "rule 18 of the SML'96
definition".)

CHANGES TO THE PARSER
=====================

Important files: parser/ml-tables/new-grammar.lisp

(note that this file has to be generated from parser/_actionfunctions.sml
using the function parser/ml-tables/back-convert.  It does not exist
in the ml distribution proper.)

In this section, I'll only document the changes rquired to add the
datatype replication declaration.  Those required for the replication
specification are similar.

To add the new production, one can't simple add a production of the form

     <DEC1> -> 
	datatype <TYCON> = datatype <LONGTYCON>

to the grammar, as suggested by the definition.  Doing this will
conflict with the rule for normal datatype declaration:

     <DEC1> -> datatype <DATBIND>

The problem being that whichever comes first in the list of rules
will override the other.  This is due to the fact that single
datatype bindings (<DATBIND1>) were specified by

     <DATBIND1> -> <TYVARSEQ><TYCON> = <CONBIND>

which shares the first three items of the datatype replication
production (when the tyvarseq is empty).  To help the parser this, I
introduce a new nonterminal <DATAHEADER> with rule

     <DATAHEADER> -> <TYVARSEQ><TYCON>=

from which the relevant rules become:

     <DEC1> -> datatype <DATREPL>
     <DEC1> -> datatype <DATBIND>
     ...

     <DATREPL> -> <DATHEADER> datatype <LONGTYCON>

     <DATBIND1> -> <DATHEADER> <CONBIND>
      ...

Note that the first rule contains a check that we are currently
in SML'96 mode: it will fail if trying to parse replication in
SML'90 mode.  Note also that in the replication, we have to check
that the tyvarseq of the datheader is empty.


CHANGES TO THE TYPECHECKER
==========================

important files: typechecker/_core_rules.sml
		 typechecker/_mod_rules.sml

Again, I'll only describe the changes to the core rules
("rule 18 of SML'96 definition").  The changes to the module rules
("rule 72 of SML'96 definition") are mostly similar.

This new clause to check_dec mirrors the rule given in the definition
almost exactly. The type checking stage consists of:

	1. lookup longtycon (error if it doesn't exist),
	2. attach the value environment associated with the
	   longtycon's type structure to the hook on the
	   abstract syntax (used in the lambda generation
	   stage)
	3. return the environment consisting of the type
	   environment assigning the type structure to tycon
	   and the value environment of the type structure.

which apart from step 2 exactly matches rule 18 of the revised definition.


CHANGES TO THE LAMBDA TRANSLATOR
================================

important file: lambda/_lambda.sml

This only concerns the replication declaration: the replication
specification seems to be ignored after typechecking.

We add a new case to the trans_dec function. (Search for
Absyn.DATATYPErepl to find the new code.)  This new code simply takes
the value environment attached to the hook on the abstract syntax and
translates it into a series of constructor bindings, suitable to be
passed to the pre-existing datatype processing functions.

Why did I choose to attach the replicated value environment to the
abstract syntax?  After all, the argument to the lambda translation
function Lambda.trans_topdec carries around a typechecker basis
argument.  Surely one could look up the longtycon in that?  I tried
this, but didn't succeed.  The reason is that the basis passed to the
lambda translator is the basis obtained at the end of the typechecking
phase.  At that stage, there is no guarantee that longtycon actually
does exist in the environment (it may have been a temporary
declaration).

Note that I can't seem to relabel the type constructors associated with
the replicated datatypes.  Thus if a constructor has type int -> 'a foo
then replicating 'a foo will not change the type: the replicated
constructor will also have type int -> 'a foo, even if the new datatype
is called "'a bar" (unless the replicated datatype belongs to a different
structure).  I've tried the following code:


            fun renameTypeName 
              (Datatypes.TYNAME(stamp,_,arity,equalityAttribute,
                                valEnvRef,_,boolRef, valEnvRef')) =
              Datatypes.TYNAME(stamp,IdentPrint.printTyCon tycon,
                               arity,equalityAttribute,valEnvRef,
                               SOME (Location.to_string location),
                               boolRef, valEnvRef')
              
              | renameTypeName 
                (Datatypes.METATYNAME(tfr,_,arity,eqAt,valEnvRef,boolRef)) =
                (Datatypes.METATYNAME(tfr,IdentPrint.printTyCon tycon,
                                      arity,eqAt,valEnvRef,boolRef))
                
                
           fun renameType (Datatypes.FUNTYPE(ty1,ty2)) =
                           Datatypes.FUNTYPE(renameType ty1,renameType ty2)
             | renameType (Datatypes.CONSTYPE(tl,tyname)) =
                           Datatypes.CONSTYPE(tl,renameTypeName tyname)
             | renameType t = t
               

to no avail.  Therefore, I propose we call this renaming a "feature" and be
done with it.
