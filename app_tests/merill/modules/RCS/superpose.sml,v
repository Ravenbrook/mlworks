devious variations on the basic superposition algorithm.

superposerep : Signature -> Term -> Term -> Term -> (Substitution * Term) list

This is a variant on superpose which in addition to finding the superpositions of the second
Term argument on the Third, takes a third argument, which should conceptually be the right-hand
side of a rewrite rule, for critical pair computation.   

What this function does is return in addition to the substitution, the term with the
rhs term inserted at place where the superposition took place.  Note that the substitution
is not applied: it will be applied to the whole term (with the rhs as a subterm)
once this function has completed.

superposerep A r t1 t2 = (s , t2[p <- r]) where s(t2|p) = s(t1)

Thus we have an more efficient method of replacing a subterm on superposition than returning a 
path which then has to be traversed to find the right occurence and replacing then.

        let fun unh Term1 subl =
                if compound Term1 then

(*
supreponsubterms :  Signature -> Term -> Term -> Term -> (Substitution * Term) list

supreponsubterms was defined in response to the observation that superposition at the root is
straight unification, and so only tries to superpose (and do replacement) on subterms.

Returns the whole term though with the superposed portion replaced.
That is what the subfunction gg does.

   	        (map (apply_snd (fn s => mk_OpTerm (root_operator T1) (done@@(s::todo))))
			        (superposerep Sigma rhs t T2 ))
