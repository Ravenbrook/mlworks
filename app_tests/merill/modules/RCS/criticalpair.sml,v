proper subterms of the first.

val cpg : Signature -> (Equality -> Equality -> Order) ->  EqualitySet -> 
		string -> Equality -> EqualitySet -> int * Equality -> EqualitySet

critical pair generation with superpose-and-replace function (ghastly)

Arguments are:

Sigma : Signature - the current signature
Order : Equality -> Equality -> Order - the current insertion order for equality sets.
R : EqualitySet - This set is used to reduce all the critical pairs
lab : string  -  the label associated with equality set R.  For printing good messages.
e1 : Equality - e1 is one of the critical expressions
EO : EqualitySet - the resulting critical pairs are merged into this equation set
(N,e2) : int * Equality - e2 is the other of the critical expressions - N is the integer associated
with it in the equality set.

returns an equality set containing all the new critical pairs in addition to the set E0.

is the main auxiliary function 
cp : Term -> EqualitySet -> (Substitution * Term) -> EqualitySet
is the main auxiliary function.  Arguments
r : Term 
L : EqualitySet - the resulting critical pairs are merged into this equation set
(s,l1) : Substitution * Term 
The critical pairs are formed from the two terms and the substitution
	CP =  s (r, l1)
and then reduced by R
	CP ->R  CPN
and then inserted into the set L.

The critical expressions are generated by the supreponsubterms, which generates the set 

superposerep A r t1 t2 = [(s , t2[p <- r]) where s(t2|p) = s(t1) and p =/= e , .... ]
