transys.sml

This module contains a specialised data structure used for the incremental 
mixfixed parsing algorithm encoded in structure for terms.  The data type 
is built up by giving the symbol form to be recognised together with the
action on recognition.

The structure currently exports the transistion system datatype together
with its constructors empty- and build- trans_system.  In addition there
is a distinguished element bracket_transys used to provide the parser for
bracketed terms.  

There are more functions in the structure than exported, which could be 
exported if necessary.  There is also no deletion function for restricting
the parsing algorithm, although there is a hook in the code for it to be 
attached to (the integer component of the Trangraph type).
