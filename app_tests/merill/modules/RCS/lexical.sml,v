MERILL  -  Equational Reasoning System in Standard ML.
Brian Matthews				     19/02/91
Glasgow University and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

This module decides the basic lexical units of the new Eril system.

The basic lexical elements that we can return are:

	NL  -  	We must give parsers the opportunity to handle newlines in 
		their own ways.
	Id  -   Any sequence of A-Za-z0-9 together with underscore "_" and
		prime "'", which must commence with a alphabetic character.
	Digit - any sequence of 0-9.
	Symbol- Symbolics are now matched one at a time !! (bmm 03-12-90 )
	Quote - any sequence of characters delimited by quotes.  The quotes are
		then quietly dropped!
	Other - any other single character - eg parentheses.

*)

structure Lex : LEXICAL =
struct 

datatype Token = Id of string | Num of int | NL

(*  
val get_lexeme : unit -> string

	if digit c then c^get_next_number () else
	if symbolic c then c else
	if c = "\"" then get_quoted () 
	else c
    end
