 *  Description
 *  -----------
 *  This library manages the address space of the runtime system process,
 *  otherwise known as the `arena'.
 *
 *  The arena is the area of address space between address 0 and 1 <<
 *  ARENA_WIDTH. It is divided into a number of large `spaces' of size
 *  1 << SPACE_WIDTH.
 * 
 *  Some spaces are further subdivided into blocks of size 1 <<
 *  BLOCK_WIDTH. Contiguous sets of blocks are allocated and freed in
 *  a manner similar to malloc(). Virtual memory is only mapped for
 *  those blocks which are currently allocated.
 *
 *  Virtual memory is mapped for a non-block space from its base to
 *  its "extent". "Holes" may be allowed in the VM mapping of such a
 *  space.
 *
 *  Each block or space is allocated a `type'.  The client of this code is
 *  free to use types from 1 to 127.  Other types are reserved.  TYPE(addr)
 *  returns the type of the block or space which contains the address addr.
 *  SPACE_TYPE(addr) is a faster version which returns the type of a space
 *  or TYPE_BLOCKS for block spaces.
