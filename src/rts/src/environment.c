 *  Implementation
 *  --------------
 *  The runtime environment is an ML list of triples.  Entries are of the
 *  form (name, type, value) where name is the bound ML string, type is one
 *  of VALUE or STUB, and value is the ML value bound.  Values of type STUB
 *  are the closures of special ML functions which interface ML to C.
 *
 *  When a C function is added to the environment a static code vector from
 *  interface.h is closed over with the address of the C function to call,
 *  as well as the addresses of the C and ML state vectors, and the
 *  environment name of the C function.  When a the global state is unpacked
 *  after an image is loaded the environment is scanned and all such stubs
 *  have their closures fixed in case these C addresses have changed.  There
 *  is a similar mechanism for assembly language code vectors.

 *  Revision Log
 *  ------------
 *  $Log: environment.c,v $
 *  Revision 1.12  1998/10/05 11:50:43  jont
 *  [Bug #70185]
 *  Avoid calling weak_add on loader_code if loader_code is DEAD
 *
 * Revision 1.11  1998/03/19  11:49:02  jont
 * [Bug #70026]
 * Allow profiling of stub_c functions, recording the time according
 * to the name of the runtime system functions
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1998/02/23  17:59:57  jont
 * [Bug #70018]
 * Modify declare_root to accept a second parameter
 * indicating whether the root is live for image save
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1997/04/30  14:44:31  stephenb
 * [Bug #30030]
 * env_function -> mlw_bind_function since this function needs
 * to be visible to external users and hence cannot pollute the
 * name space.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1996/09/10  11:31:38  nickb
 * Add missing retract_root().
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1996/05/15  14:58:12  nickb
 * Report multiple missing bindings before causing an error.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1996/02/19  16:59:12  nickb
 * Clear environment on delivery.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1996/02/16  14:37:57  nickb
 * Change to declare_global().
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1996/02/14  14:54:39  jont
 * Changing ERROR to MLERROR
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1994/12/12  15:15:48  jont
 * Convert function pointers to MLINTs under NT
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/06/09  14:34:46  nickh
 * new file
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/06/09  11:00:15  nickh
 * new file
 *
 *  Revision 1.11  1993/04/28  14:48:56  jont
 *  Changed env_function and env_asm_function to return the closure produced
 *
 *  Revision 1.10  1993/02/01  14:36:35  richard
 *  Abolished SETFIELD and GETFIELD in favour of lvalue FIELD.
 *
 *  Revision 1.9  1992/10/26  13:51:30  richard
 *  env_lookup() now returns an error code rather than raising
 *  and exception directly.  It is no longer called directly
 *  from ML.  See pervasives.c.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  1992/08/26  15:44:50  richard
 *  Failure to find a binding in the runtime environment now
 *  raises an exception instead of bombing.
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  1992/08/04  16:14:51  richard
 *  Made sure that the stub code addresses are fixed as well as the actual
 *  functions.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  1992/07/31  08:10:53  richard
 *  The C and assembler calling stubs are now single static routines.
 *  (Too many problems were caused by replicating them.)
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  1992/07/30  17:07:01  richard
 *  Commented out profile_new() until I can fix it.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  1992/07/30  11:51:47  richard
 *  Stub code vectors are now static strings.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  1992/07/29  14:26:12  richard
 *  New code vectors are declared to the profiler rather than the loader.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  1992/07/29  12:16:06  richard
 *  Changed the environment from a list of weak arrays to a simple
 *  list of triples.  It shouldn't have been weak anyway!
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  1992/07/27  16:18:28  richard
