 *
 *  Description
 *  -----------
 *  These declarations deal with the allocation of memory, including
 *  creation of generations, stacks, etc. for the garbage collector.
 *
 *  We deal with 5 kinds of objects: ML stack blocks, C stack blocks,
 * C heap blocks, generations, and static ML object spaces. The C
 * struct declarations are here, as are functions to make, delete,
 * resize, &c.
 *
 *  This module requests pieces of memory from the arena manager, in
 *  'blocks' (fixed size, typically 64k) and 'spaces' (variable size
 *  with fixed alignment, typically 16 Mb). Generations are given a
 *  space each. Static objects are allocated in static spaces. The ML
 *  stack and the C heap are allocated in blocks. See arena.h for more
 *  information.
 *
 *  We define several new types for memory: TYPE_STATIC, TYPE_GEN,
 *  TYPE_FROM, TYPE_STACK, TYPE_HEAP. These are used in the type maps
 *  defined by the arena manager.
 *
 *  For more information, see the comments below.

 *  Added entry list link structure to generation header.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  1992/01/17  11:41:54  richard
 *  Removed dodgy version of malloc() and free().  See new alloc.h.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  1992/01/08  11:47:58  richard
 *  Changed the type of stacktop to a void *.  Added INITIAL_STACK_SIZE.
 *

 *  added header and comment
 *  
 *  Revision 1.1  91/12/17  16:15:29  nickh
