    (* OUTPUT: *)

    (* Now life gets interesting...  We want to use an exit hook to close 
       output streams when the program exits.  But exit hooks are inherited
       by delivered executables.  So we may end up including lots of stuff in
       a delivered image even if it doesn't use the basis IO.  So we want to
       remove the exit hook before delivery, and reinstall it afterwards.  
       The variable exit_function_key holds a key to the installed exit 
       hook for closing streams, or NONE if the exit function is not
       installed.  When we deliver an executable we use the key to remove the
       exit function. But what establishes the hook in a delivered executable?
       It has to be reestablished only if the executable is running code that
       uses StreamIO.  Luckily, every operation on output streams already has
       to deal with a variety of stream types, e.g. terminated.  So we add
       a new case to outputter called Delivered that every open output stream's
       writer state is set to when a function is delivered.  On encountering 
       a stream in such a state we reestablish the exit function if necessary,
       and change the writer state back to what it was before delivery. *)
