# Change to use .version file instead of .compound file

# [Bug #1463]
# tweaked findcomp but did not wish to disturb dependent scripts, so added it as this...

# Returned the parent of the directory containing the .compound file
# instead of the directory itself, so that check-ins and check-outs
# of multiple files can be based in the same directory.

# Climbs the directory tree up from the argument, searching for a
# .compound file. When it finds one, constructs compound and unit names
# accordingly.

# Meant for use as eval `findcomp foo/bar`, in which case it defines 3
# shell variables: 
#
# $unit: the unit name
# $compound: the compound name
# $dir: the compound directory
